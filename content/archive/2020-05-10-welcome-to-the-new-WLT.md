**NOTE:** The domain has migrated to [https://wlt.coffee](https://wlt.coffee).
Using the old [.soy](https://wlt.soy) extension will redirect to the new domain
until December 2020. After that, I'll cancel the old domain. Readers who
continue to use the old URL will be sent into Internet oblivion.

## New Features
The old website felt like something circa 2000. I'm proud to announce it's
been updated to about 2010.

### Table of Contents
{{< figure src="/images/welcome-to-the-new-wlt/toc_icon.svg"
   alt="table of contents icon"
   caption="Table of Contents icon"
   class="left" >}}

Longer posts now feature a table of contents! Clicking on the icon will bring
up a quick guide linking important sections of the page. **NOTE**: this feature
only works on desktop.


### Featured Image
{{< figure src="/images/welcome-to-the-new-wlt/feat_image_icon.svg"
   alt="featured image icon"
   caption="Featured Image icon"
   class="left" >}}

Particularly epic posts (like this one) now have a "featured image." The image
is watermarked into the background. Clicking on the icon brings it into focus.
Click the image again to return to the post.


### Clickable Tags
Like what you've read? Now find more! All tags for a post are included at the
bottom. Clicking on a tag brings up a page of posts with the same or related
tags.

### Raised General Level of Epicness
* Auto-hide navbar
* Improved mobile friendliness
* Redesigned icon
* Smoother feel
* Cleaner layout
* Switch to Hugo backend
* Enchanted by 9th-level sorcerers
* Imbued with dragon's blood and phoenix tears
* Left out in the sun for too long --- hence the background color

## And to all my loyal readers
all (about three) of you, thanks for following along. It's been a pleasure to
write for you, and I promise many more epic post to come. And as always,
[let me know what you think]({{< ref "about.md#about-the-blog ">}}). Flame is
appreciated.
