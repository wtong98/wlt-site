Or is it? To what extent can artificial agents be considered living beings? Is
it ever right to assign personhood to an AI?

*Audience: you, especially if you've ever owned a Tamagotchi*

This post started life as a project for a data science ethics class. Together
with my excellent collaborators [Zach
Murray](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/zack-murray) and [Kimon
Vogt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimon-aristotelis-v-5695b7174/), we explored a
tentative, prescriptive criteria for evaluating personhood in AI systems. Our
original discussion, from which parts of this piece has been cribbed, can be
found
[here](https://wtong-harvard.notion.site/A-criteria-for-personhood-in-artificially-intelligent-systems-1c3d3ce61d5041e3af5f6bb590050b3d).

**Note:** personhood is a gnarly topic, fraught with deep philosophical
quagmires and thorny legal issues. The following post is a casual discussion of
personhood *as it applies to AI only*, and is intended solely for entertainment
and education. I make no claims about personhood broadly, and do not aim
to build any grand, rigorous, theoretical foundations.

## A concert like no other
It was a crisp, autumn afternoon, October, 1997. Students, professors, and music
enthusiasts gathered at the University of Oregon for a Bach recital, excited for
an hour of cerebral music and Baroque discussion. Esteemed pianist Winifred
Kerner performed three pieces for the captivated audience.

Only one was a true Bach.
