A casual tour of Bayes' Theorem (with math!)

*audience: you! even if you're allergic to math*
<!--more-->

Without further ado, here it is:

$$ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} $$


### Bayes' Theorem in English
The probability of a model $A$ given an observation $B$ is equal to the product
of 1\) the likelihood of $B$ under $A$ and 2\) the prior on $A$, then divided
by the marginal of $B$.

### Bayes' Theorem in plain English
The probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is equal to the product of
1\) the probability of the event $B$ given the event $A$ and 2\) the marginal
probability of event $A$, then divided by the marginal probability of event $B$.


### Baye's Theorem in super plain, zero-jargon, cut-the-BS-and-say-what-you-mean English
If you toss a "fair" coin and it comes up heads 9 times out of 10, what
are you gonna bet on the 11th toss, dummy?

The last one isn't really a definition of Bayes' Theorem, but it captures the
essence. At the end of the day, Bayes' Theorem is nothing more than a fancy
way of describing a very human intuition about probability: if something
happened a lot in the past, it will probably keep happening a lot in the
future.
