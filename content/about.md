I'm a student at Columbia University, burgeoning software engineer, and
freshly-minted blogger. I enjoy reading, running, and plant-based whole foods. I
don't enjoy grades, sitting too long, and not-plant-based not-whole (partial?) foods.

## About the blog

Just doodling my thoughts on a personal stretch of the Interwebs.
Because of my background, the themes tend towards the technical, but I hope
you'll find a little bit of everything for everyone.

For the curious folks, this site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com/wtong98/wtong98.github.io)
and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Feel free to
check out the details in the [repo](https://github.com/wtong98/wlt-site).

This website is still under heavy construction. If you have any ideas for
further improvement, please don't hesistate to reach out! Email at the bottom.
Flame is appreciated.
